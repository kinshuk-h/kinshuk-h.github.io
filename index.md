Hello There!

I'm a third year
~~coffee addict~~
Ph.D. student
at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/),
advised by Professor [Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com).

I'm interested in making language models accessible to all, by understanding
and improving their multilingual capabilities. I aspire to
improve model abilities in a manner that is equitable across languages.
I'm also passionate about interpretability and
alignment of large language models.

Recently, I've interned as a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, Bangalore,
where I worked with [Vihari Piratla](https://vihari.github.io/) and [Partha Talukdar](https://research.google/people/parthatalukdar/) towards improving multilingual evaluation for foundational models.

Outside research, I enjoy cooking, programming and completing obscure 8-bit RPG games.

I'm open to chat about research, collaborations, or otherwise! Feel free to reach out to me at [kinshukv@iisc.ac.in](mailto:kinshukv@iisc.ac.in).
